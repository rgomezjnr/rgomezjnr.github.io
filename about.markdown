I received my B.S. in Computer Engineering from San Diego State University in 2014.

I've proudly contributed to critical industries such as diabetes medical devices, satellite
communications, computing, and defense.

I'm currently working at [Tandem Diabetes Care](https://www.tandemdiabetes.com) as a software
engineer in test automation. As a test lead I write automated test scripts for the
[t:connect mobile app](https://www.tandemdiabetes.com/products/software-apps/tconnect-mobile). I
also create DevOps continuous testing pipelines.

In my spare time I enjoy playing softball, shooting pool, and skateboarding.
